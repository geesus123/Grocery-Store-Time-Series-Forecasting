Sales Prediction: A Time Series Forecasting Approach with Statistical Methods

This project aims to explore the time series forecasting approach with statistical methods, specifically SARIMAX. The dataset utilised will be from a kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview) which is from an Ecuadorian company, Corporaci√≥n Favorita and it is a large grocery retailer.

Note: For this project, not all data from the datasets are used. This project focuses only on the oil, train and transactions data. More information can be found in the documentation.
